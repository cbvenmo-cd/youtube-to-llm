# Production Mode Test Results

## Current Status

The server is running in **production mode**, but there's an API key mismatch issue.

### Test Results:

1. **Server Mode**: ✅ Production mode confirmed
   - Mode: production
   - Environment: local
   - Mode switching allowed: true

2. **API Authentication**: ❌ Failed
   - Server is rejecting the API key `41e8b937002d320b690c646cfb914d28`
   - Error: "Invalid API key"

### Issue Diagnosis:

The server is not recognizing the API key from the `.env` files. This typically happens when:

1. The server was started without the `API_KEY` environment variable
2. The Docker container doesn't have access to the environment variable
3. The server is reading a different API key value

### How to Fix:

1. **Stop the current server**

2. **Restart with the correct API key**:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker:
   AUTH_MODE=production API_KEY=41e8b937002d320b690c646cfb914d28 docker-compose up

   # Using Node directly:
   AUTH_MODE=production API_KEY=41e8b937002d320b690c646cfb914d28 npm start

   # Or use the run script:
   ./run-prod.sh
   ```

3. **Verify the fix**:
   ```bash
   # Test the API directly:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"apiKey": "41e8b937002d320b690c646cfb914d28", "rememberMe": true}'
   ```

4. **Run the Puppeteer tests**:
   ```bash
   node test-production-mode.js
   ```

### What Works:

- ✅ Server is in production mode
- ✅ Login page is accessible
- ✅ Login form elements are present
- ✅ Puppeteer can interact with the page
- ✅ Request interception shows correct data being sent

### What Needs Fixing:

- ❌ Server needs to be restarted with the correct API_KEY environment variable

Once the server is restarted with the correct API key, the production mode tests will work perfectly, demonstrating:
- Automatic login form filling
- Cookie persistence for 90-day sessions
- Session management across browser restarts
